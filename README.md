# Call of Cthulhu, Portland, Maine Campaign
## Preparatory Information
The year is 1942. The United States has entered the Great War, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in a sneak attack meant to cripple the US military. Europe is all but ready to topple to the Nazi war machine, as fascism spreads like wildfire. 

Which brings us to the state of Maine, and the town of Portland. A cradle of lush green countryside to one side, and the rolling blue of the ocean on the other. To most, such a town would be a peaceful dream; a paradise unrivaled amongst the stars. However, peace is not something residents enjoy...

In 1899, the town of Deering, Maine, was annexed by Portland, causing a stir amongst both Deering residents and a rift between the two populations. Often, residents withhold which particular township they were or would have been a part of when Deering was still a town, but in such cases as opposing sides are known and forced into a social situation, it is not uncommon for both parties to decidedly leave in a fit. In the curious case of Don Tilly in 1923, however, Sammy "the Stone" Jenkins reportedly Don to death after such a situation that ended poorly outside of Mathew's Pub, forever marring the spot. The townsfolk held a candlelight vigil for Don, and both sides begrudgingly came together for the event, swore to end the conflict and went back to business as usual the next day. No one was going to change for "Drunk Donny." Sammy was convicted of murder and privately hanged later that month after a short trial. The service was done without the body being
present due to an oversight at the prison.

The local milkman, Darryl Whitcomb, has disappeared during a camping trip in to the Acadia National Park. A strange and quiet fellow, Bernard Cosgrove, has decidedly taken his post. Darryl was well-liked by the townsfolk, though his deliveries were oft erratic and at times, the milk bottles had obviously been roughly handled; but Darryl was a kind and friendly soul. Darryl was beloved by both Deering and original Portlanders, "or Porties," as Deering-folk called them. As it is now late summer, the sheriff, Sheriff Dwight Edwards, has organized search parties to look for Darryl and help the authorities from Trenton, Maine. 

## Character Creation
Flesh out your stories. The best way to enjoy the full horror of Lovecraftian tales is to fully immerse yourself in your character. Understand them, know their lives, and experience their sheer terror as they unravel slowly. For gazing into the void alone is not cause for insanity, but seeing what stares back is enough to drive civilizations mad. Call of Cthulhu is not a game about killing the "bad guys," but one of survival.

## General Hints and Pointers
- There is no FBI, CIA, NSA, etc... These "three letter agencies" did not exist, but there is the precursor to all of them.. There is the War Department.
- Technology and how people behave is very different from then, and now.
- Patriotism is at an all-time high, as is paranoia of spies and Nazi infiltrators.
- People are far more superstitious than in the modern era.
