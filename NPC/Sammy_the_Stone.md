# Sammy "the Stone" Jenkins
## Background
Sammy is seen as a local thug. Born in a small town in Wisconsin, he moved to Portland with a young thing that didn't know any better than to attach herself to him.
## Appearance
Sammy is a stoic figure. Average height, strong build. He's obviously seen his fair share of hardship, and it shows in every wrinkle and callous. Prison time has been hard on him, and scars marr his once handsome face. He carries himself quickly and quietly as if to avoid notice, and his face is devoid of emotion.
## Townsfolk Rumor Mill
- Sammy denies having killed Don Tilly. Claims he left him alive on the side of the road. Beaten and bruised, but not seriously injured.
- Rumors are spreading that a ghost carved Don Tilly apart.
- Some say Don Tilly could breathe underwater and had spent so much time at sea, he had actually began to turn in to a fish; or at least Don drank like one..
